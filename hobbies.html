<h1>MY HOBBIES</h1>

<p>There are lots of things that I'm interested in from spending my time listening to songs to star gazing and few things to hone my skills some of which I have tried to summarize here:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Playing Football</h3>
        <p>Playing football gives me the relaxation I need, helps me clear my head and keeps me sane at times.</p>

        <h3>Watching Movies</h3>
        <p>I love to watch Sci-fi movies and Documentries.Christopher Nolan is an inspiring Director to me ,I like the way he projects his thoughts through the movies and the technicalities.</p>

        <h3>Reading Books</h3>
